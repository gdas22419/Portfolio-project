What are Sales Performance Metrics?  LINK :https://blog.close.com/which-sales-metrics/

	Sales performance metrics are data points that represent a sales rep, sales team, and/or company’s overall 
	sales success in achieving total revenue goals, new customer acquisition, retention, sales activities, and
	 other indicators. They help track goals and growth. They are used to determine compensation, incentives, and 
	 bonuses. 
	 
Common Sales Metrics to Measure

1. Sales activity metrics:
	Are you making enough calls, connecting with prospects, scheduling demos, and completing them?

2. Pipeline management metrics:
	Are your activities generating qualified leads that result in proposals being created and sent? 
	Have your leads become customers? What’s your close rate?
	
3. Sales results metrics:
	How long is your average sales cycle? What is your generated average revenue per user 
	(ARPU)? What is your total sales volume? How are you rated in customer satisfaction surveys by both new and existing customers?
	
4. Sales Conversion Rate
	Your conversion rate is the percentage of people who enter your sales funnel and come out the other side after completing a specific action, such as a purchase. Conversion rates beyond closed sales that may be measured include:

	Subscription signups
	Form submissions
	Customer referrals
	Webinar attendees
	Social media engagement
	Free-trial conversions
	
5. Sales Cycle Length
	The sales cycle is the steps that salespeople take to turn a lead into a customer. 
	Some stages that may be included in the sales cycle are prospecting, qualifying, 
	researching, connecting, pitching, addressing objections, following up, closing,
	and asking for referrals. At your company, different people may be involved throughout the process 
	like a prospect researcher or a scheduler. Your company will determine when the sales cycle begins 
	and ends and what they deem an ideal period of time is for a full cycle.

	Average Sales Cycle Length =
	Total Number of Days to Close All Deals / Total Number of Deals
	
6. Average Deal Size
	In many cases, the easiest way to increase revenue is to sell more to each customer. 
	Tracking your average deal size lets you see how your sales value is trending.
	While you want the average deal size to increase, you might also find that it is decreasing. 
	If nothing else has changed with your product or sales methodology, perhaps the quality of your leads has decreased.

	Average Deal Size =
	Total Sales Revenue / Total Number of Sales
	
7. Sales Pipeline Size
	As your leads are qualified, they enter the sales pipeline. This metric is important because any significant changes to
	 your pipeline size may indicate the need to hire more salespeople or put more effort into building a sales pipeline.
	
8. Average Churn Rate
	Churn measures the customers who tried out your product/service and then canceled their subscription or account. 
	While there may be some unavoidable churn when a customer goes out of business, for example, these instances are
	few and far between. Learning more about churn can help set reasonable key performance indicators around churn.

	Average Churn Rate =
	(100 x Number of Customers Lost) / Starting Number of Customers
	
9. Customer Retention
	The opposite of customer churn is customer retention. Customer loyalty in the era of unlimited choices is a critical
	component of your company’s ongoing success. Luckily, the number one factor in customer retention is an exceptional 
	customer experience - something that your company has lots of control over. Should you notice a significant drop in retention, 
	it’s time to ask yourself why it’s happening and how you can address it.

	Customer Retention Rate =
	(100 x Number of Customers Retained) / Starting Number of Customers
	
10 . Customer Acquisition Cost
	Unlike a one-time purchase, the long-term recurring revenue factor with SaaS means the customer acquisition cost can be 
	spread across several months. Therefore, SaaS companies can strategically invest more in acquiring customers. Monitoring 
	your customer acquisition cost can be an important metric that includes advertising, staffing expenses, creative costs,
	publishing fees, promotional costs, sales commissions, prospect list purchases, and sales events/trade shows.

	Customer Acquisition Cost =
	(Cost of Sales + Cost of Marketing) / (New Customers Acquired)
	
11. ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account)
	ARPU or Average Revenue Per User is calculated by dividing your total revenue in a time period by the total number of paying
	customers. This metric can be used to figure out the net number of new accounts required to hit a financial goal. In many cases,
	the ARPU and ARPA will be the same. If you sell a product or service that sells per-user licenses, there may be times when a strict 
	ARPU is calculated. Another term for this is Average Revenue Per Customer (APRC). You’ll want to work with your company leadership
	to determine the exact calculations for each for your unique situation.

	ARPU or ARPC =
	Total Revenue / Average Number of Users or Customers
	
12. MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
	Most SaaS users love the ability to pay monthly. It’s easier on their cash flow than a big upfront investment. Tracking monthly 
	recurring revenue is also done to understand your company’s cash flow. Monthly Recurring Revenue includes all recurring charges and adjustments 
	from active subscriptions, add-ons, discounts, coupons, and active promotions. It is important to not simply look up all customers with
	 subscriptions and their total monthly revenue as one-time fees such as data overage charges should not be included and should be treated
	 as auxiliary revenue.
	 
13. Annual Subscription Percentage
	Ideally, a number of your SaaS customers will sign up for annual deals. This not only helps lock in customer revenue and provide
	a larger initial investment while immediately covering customer acquisition costs, but provides you with opportunities to build
	good customer rapport and supportive relationships over the contract period.

	Annual Subscription Percentage =
	(100 x Total # of Annual Plan Accounts) / Total # of Accounts
	
14. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
	When tracking sales metrics, invest time in calculating annual recurring revenue (ARR).
	Several critical KPIs are part of the ARR including average revenue per user and customer lifetime value (LTV).

	ARR is often broken down into metrics with the following statistics:

	ARR from new customers
	ARR from existing customers
	ARR from customers on a promotional annual payment plan (vs. monthly)
	ARR generated from upgrades and add-ons
	ARR lost to downgrades
	ARR churn rate
	
	ARR is closely tied to another metric, ![Screenshot (52)]
monthly recurring revenue (MRR), which is often measured in relation to cash 
	flow needs rather than the overall financial and sales forecasts.
	
15. Annual Recurring Revenue =
	(Monthly Recurring Revenue* x 12) + Total Annual Plan Revenue
	* This formula assumes that monthly recurring revenue is ongoing and not term-limited.
	
16. Average Net Contract Value
	Each contract signed means more profit for the company, right? The answer is maybe. To determine this metric,
	take the total contract value minus the implementation or onboarding costs, the customer acquisition cost, 
	and the cost of goods or services sold for the contract. You may find your customer base doesn’t generate the profit
	margin you expected. The Average Net Contract Value shows the financial impact of gained or lost accounts.

	Average Net Contract Value =
	Gross Contract Revenue - (Total Cost of Goods/Services / Total # of Customers)

The AQC Framework and Examples
To keep sales metrics simple, we like to use the AQC framework, which stands for:

Activity
Quality
Conversion
A = Activity: Covers what your team is doing on a daily basis to close more sales and grow revenue.

Q = Quality: Refers both to the quality of the salesperson’s work and the lead/prospect pool.

C = Conversion: Measures the number (or percentage) of customers who move on to the next stage in the sales cycle,\
 including changing from a lead/prospect to an opportunity to a customer.

These three data points are enough for any sales organization to make informed decisions and optimize performance. 
Here are two examples of the AQC framework at work.


Example 1: Sales Team Cold-Call-A-Lot
A(ctivity): How many numbers do they dial? How many attempted calls (no matter how many of these calls got answered, 
went to voicemail, or got lost in dial tone limbo)? How many use messaging provided in optimized call scripts? 
Are sales reps doing appropriate follow-up calls? What is the total amount of time being spent trying to reach someone versus actually talking to someone?

Q(uality): What’s the reach rate (number of people reached/number of dials made 100. e.g. 15/100100=15% reach rate)?
 How many times do you actually get to speak with a decision maker on the phone?

C(onversions): How many of the people you spoke with did you convert on the phone? How you define a conversion depends 
on your sales process: scheduling a demo, making a sale, signing up for a free trial, setting up an in-person meeting, and other benchmarks.

These three sales metrics are everything the Cold-Call-A-Lot sales team needs to know. They tell you which part of your
 sales process needs to be improved first: Do you need to dial more numbers? Is your reach rate too low? Are you reaching a 
 lot of people, but failing to convert? Looking at cold calling conversion analytics can tell you.

Example 2: Sales Team Cold-Email-A-Lot
If you’re mostly doing cold emails, your AQC would be:

A(ctivity): How many emails did you send?

Q(uality): How many of those emails were received and opened?

C(onversion): How many responses did you get (or clicks on a link if that is your desired conversion)?

Again, this simple framework gives the Cold-Email-A-Lot sales team exactly what they need to optimize their process and close more deals.

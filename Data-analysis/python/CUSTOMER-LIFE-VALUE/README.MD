This report represents my analysis for the auto Insurance company. It is my opinion that based on the data provided, targeting appropriate customers could increase the Customer Lifetime Value. The two proposed changes are as follows:

A) Insurance company should target educated married employed customers from Urban areas having Mid Size vehicles to increase the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) increase.

B) On the other hand, if customer's Open Complaints would not be resolved soon and claim amount would not bring down, then both could decrease the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

C) About 38% value was added by the agents to the company whereas call centers added only 20% value. So agents should be preferred over call centers while selling the auto insurance to customers.

D) Factors which are responsible for increasing the CLV are Monthly Premium and Number of Policies, however Open Complaints and Claim Amount can decrease the CLV.
